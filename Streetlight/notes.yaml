  An entity of type `Streetlight` represents a urban streetlight. Actually, there  will be an entity of type `Streetlight` per lamp. Thus, if a particular pole   holds more than one lantern there will be as many streetlight entites as   installed lamps. As a result there might be more than one streetlight entity per   location. A `Streetlight` entity does not contain any attribute corresponding to structural characteristics. Such data is captured by entities of type `StreetlightModel`.
